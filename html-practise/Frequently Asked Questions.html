  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <p>What is digital marketing?
    Digital marketing encompasses all forms of advertising and marketing using the internet,
    from search engine optimization (SEO) to content marketing, social media and more.</p>

    <p> What's a digital marketing agency?
    A digital marketing agency is a business (like us!) which assists other companies with their
    online marketing efforts. Agencies can be as involved as the client would like. For some of 
    our clients we handle all digital projects but for others we only provide ideas and 
    recommendations through consulting. Our goal is to be an extension of our clients teams, 
    support internal marketing teams with specialized digital services. </p>
    
    <p> What's the difference between B2B and B2C digital marketing?
    B2B stands for Business-to-Business. This type of marketing refers to businesses who sell 
    products or services to other business. For example, at Blue Compass we work with other 
    businesses to produce stellar digital marketing campaigns. B2C stands for 
    Business-to-Consumer, or businesses that sell their products or services to individual consumers.
    While all facets of digital marketing can apply to both B2B and B2C, the strategy will differ.</p>
