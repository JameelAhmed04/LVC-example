  <h2>what is copyright law?</h2>

  <p>The copyright law of the United States grants monopoly protection for "original works of authorship".</p>

  <h2>What are the consequences for breaking copyright law?</h2>
  <p>Infringement is usually treated as civil offence but can, in certain circumstances, be deemed a criminal 
    offence, with damages awarded by a court. Depending on the severity of the infringement, the result can
    be a fine or even imprisonment.</p>
